# BalenaOS Developer Kit Nano Setup Instructions for MaskCam
This page provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the Jetson Nano Developer Kit with balenaOS, rather than NVIDIA's JetPack OS. BalenaOS is a barebones host operating system optimized for running Docker containers. It allows MaskCam to easily be installed as a container and remotely updated or configured.


## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create balena account
Evan or John can work on this part


### 2. Create new application and device on balena dashboard
Evan or John can work on this part. This part includes using balena dashboard to create a new application and device, and then flashing the device image onto an SD card and installing it in the Jetson Nano Developer Kit.


### 3. Deploy MaskCam code to balena device
(John can work on this part... Evan doesn't know how it works yet :grimacing: )


### 4. Running MaskCam on device
Evan or John can work on this part.
Still need to test out Braulio's new code that automatically starts MaskCam on powerup to see how it works.

### What else?
